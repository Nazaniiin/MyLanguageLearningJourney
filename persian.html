        <p class="language-desc">Being born in Iran, Persian is my mother tongue. I love this language, and always
           encourage those who want to learn it. The current Persian alphabet is inherited from Arabic,
           with other extra characters specific to Persian.
           One of the fascinating aspects of the Persian language is the variety of sounds present in the
           alphabet. This makes it much easier for Persian speakers to be able to for example pronounce
           the 'r' sound in French. There are many other sounds in Persian that are difficult
           for many other languages to pronounce.
           I'd say the challenging part about learning Persian is the alphabet; otherwise, you can learn to
           speak the language in a relatively short time.
