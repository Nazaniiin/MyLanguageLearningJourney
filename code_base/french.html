        <p class="language-desc">To me, French has always been a language I've been fascinated about.
            Everything made in French also always gets me excited e.g. music and movies. I also love
            France for its delicious food and pastries.

            I am self-studying French at the moment. My level is pretty basic, and I read grammar and
            vocabulary books to get to know the structure of the language a bit.  
            My french pronunciation is okay, but I still need practice.
            I would like to travel to France in the near future, and visit different cities there.
            I really like to be able to communicate in French by that time.
