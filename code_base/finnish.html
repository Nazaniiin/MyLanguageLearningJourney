        <p class="language-desc">The main reason I started learning Finnish was living in Finland.
            It's no surprise that Finnish is a difficult language to learn. The language belongs
            to the Uralic family, which also includes Estonian and Hungarian.
            My relationship with this language didn't start on good terms. At first, learning it
            was forced to me, but after passing the intermediate level language test, I became motivated
            to advance in Finnish. I am now studying by myself, and trying to immerse myself more in the 
            Finnish culture.

            <p>To self-study Finnish, <a href="http://suomenmestari.fi">Suomen Mestari books</a> are pretty helpful. They have lots of exercises
            which focus on Grammar and Vocabulary.</p>
            
            <p>There are currently for levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic: Suomen Mestari 1 </li>
                <li>Elementary: Suomen Mestari 2</li>
                <li>Intermediate: Suomen Mestari 3</li>
